## What Amadeus is trying to solve

Voice assistants, desktop characters, and execution agents usually live in
separate windows: one chats, one performs, and another works in a terminal or
browser. Once a long task starts, it is difficult to see what is happening,
which permission is needed, or whether the work can recover after a failure.

Amadeus connects those experiences into one loop:

1. **Talk — communicate naturally:** speak or type, with interruption across generation, synthesis, and physical playback.
2. **Embody — make the agent present:** voice, subtitles, lip sync, expression, and scene behavior share one playback timeline.
3. **Act — delegate real work:** the main role delegates to registered Work Providers instead of receiving every tool directly.
4. **Control — stay in charge:** Projects, Drafts, Artifacts, progress, permissions, diffs, and results remain visible and recoverable.

The character communicates and narrates, specialized Providers execute, and
the Host owns identity, state, permissions, persistence, and recovery.

## Demo highlights

| Real-time conversation and performance | Scene-aware working state |
|---|---|
| ![The character speaking in a real-time voice conversation with synchronized subtitles](./assets/demo/conversation.jpg) | ![The character moves into a working scene and reports the Provider's research result](./assets/demo/scene-runtime.jpg) |
| Voice, subtitles, lip sync, and expression follow actual playback. | Background work drives character behavior, scene state, and result narration. |

The video demonstrates real-time voice, character performance, desktop scenes,
Browser / OpenClaw tasks, and a paper-research flow. The desktop UI, Provider
integration, and asset boundaries have continued to evolve, so the video is a
product slice rather than a pixel-exact installation preview.

## Current capabilities

| Area | Current public source |
|---|---|
| **Interruptible real-time conversation** | Shared microphone lifecycle, independent Wake / Conversation ASR, two-stage endpointing, AEC / barge-in, and interruption across LLM, TTS, and physical playback. |
| **Remote Main Chat and local voice** | DeepSeek V4 Flash Main Chat; Qwen3-ASR / SenseVoice; embedded GPT-SoVITS v3 streaming synthesis, continuous playback, and mouth values published before matching PCM windows. |
| **Character and desktop presentation** | SpriteForge graph state, a KTX2/PixiJS runtime, subtitle, lip-sync, and emotion timing; Chat, Work, and headless startup remain available without a character pack. |
| **Provider Runtime** | Browser, Codex App Server / Direct Codex, and optional OpenClaw are current Providers. Claude CLI is a committed future direct Provider. |
| **Durable Work control plane** | Projects, default Drafts, WorkItems / Attempts, Continue / Retry, restart recovery, permissions, the Artifact Registry, and structured diffs. |
| **Artifacts and AUIP** | A Work Artifact can be previewed, opened, or attached as a bounded AUIP AppSession so Amadeus can interact with it without turning narration into execution authority. |
| **Unified settings** | Models, Voice, Providers/MCP, vision, character-pack status, and chat appearance are managed in Electron Settings. |

MCP and Skills remain compatible-Provider capabilities even when they share a
Host registry; **Main Chat cannot invoke MCP tools directly**. Remote DeepSeek
is the Main Chat baseline; remote ASR/TTS remain explicit compatibility routes.
A local voice failure never silently uploads data or creates a second billable request.

## Architecture

[![Current Amadeus architecture: Host authority, Work Providers, Provider-scoped MCP/Skills, AUIP AppSessions, voice, and SpriteForge presentation](./assets/architecture-overview-crt.svg)](./assets/architecture-overview-crt.svg)

Three separations are deliberate:

- Main Chat, Work Providers, and AUIP applications are distinct authority domains.
- A shared MCP/Skill registry does not expose those capabilities directly to Main Chat.
- Artifacts, identity, permission, and receipts are Host-verified facts; model narration cannot replace them.

Codex currently connects through App Server or Direct transport without the
retired Locus gateway. Claude CLI will join the same boundary later as an
independent direct Provider, not by restoring Locus.

## AUIP application sessions

AUIP is Amadeus's cooperative application protocol. It is not a Provider, MCP,
or Main Chat tool system. It addresses a different problem: once Work has
created a runnable Artifact, how can Amadeus continue collaborating with that
application while preserving Host authority?

```text
verified Work Artifact
  -> Host prepares a short-lived attach ticket
  -> application registers declared state/events/actions
  -> bounded AppSession
  -> character receives scoped projection and action receipts
```

- The ticket binds the current Session, an immutable Artifact reference, and a TTL. The application submits an Artifact id, not an arbitrary path.
- The Host validates workspace ownership, type, digest, and launch entry, and owns AppSession identity, revision, and action authority.
- The application may publish only declared state and semantic events and receive only declared, authorized typed actions.
- AUIP grants no `work.*`, `provider.*`, `tts.*`, arbitrary filesystem, or other-Session authority.
- Disconnects become visible state and invalidate pending actions instead of continuing against stale application state.

The current schema is `amadeus.auip/v0` and is implemented here. See
[AUIP application sessions](docs/auip_application_sessions.md). The separate
[Code-Amadeus/auip](https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/auip) repository is still a
public namespace placeholder; this release does not claim a standalone SDK or
conformance suite.

## Quick start — remote Chat + CUDA 12.4 local voice baseline

The first release follows the configuration used by the current Amadeus
runtime: Windows 11, CUDA 12.4, remote DeepSeek Main Chat, local
Qwen/SenseVoice, and GPT-SoVITS v3. llama.cpp remains an optional local LLM
profile rather than an installation requirement.

### Reference hardware

- Windows 11
- CPython **3.12** (`3.12.10` is the current reference)
- Node.js **22** (`22.21.1` is the current reference)
- CUDA 12.4-compatible NVIDIA GPU, targeting **8 GiB VRAM**
- **16 GiB system RAM minimum; 32 GiB recommended**

Peak memory depends on local ASR/TTS models and concurrency. The target describes
the remote-Chat/local-voice profile. An optional local LLM needs additional
memory according to its model, quantization, context, and GPU offload.

### Install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/Amadeus.git
cd Amadeus

py -3.12 -m venv .venv_cu124
.\.venv_cu124\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip==26.2 setuptools==83.0.0 wheel==0.47.0
.\.venv_cu124\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-cu124.txt
.\.venv_cu124\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e .
.\.venv_cu124\Scripts\python.exe tools\verify_python_environment.py --profile cu124 --require-cuda-device

cd electron
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..
```

`npm ci` uses the project postinstall hook to fetch the pinned Electron runtime.
The cu124 profile fixes `torch==2.5.1+cu124`, `torchaudio==2.5.1+cu124`, and the
local-model dependency set.

### Install external runtime assets

The full local-voice profile needs the Qwen ASR and GPT-SoVITS v3 voice packs.
The visual and character packs are optional:

```powershell
py -3.12 tools\external_assets.py verify C:\Downloads\amadeus-asr-qwen3-0.6b.zip
py -3.12 tools\external_assets.py install C:\Downloads\amadeus-asr-qwen3-0.6b.zip
py -3.12 tools\external_assets.py verify C:\Downloads\amadeus-voice-kurisu-gpt-sovits-v3.zip
py -3.12 tools\external_assets.py install C:\Downloads\amadeus-voice-kurisu-gpt-sovits-v3.zip

# Optional scene and KTX2 character animation
py -3.12 tools\external_assets.py install C:\Downloads\amadeus-visual-runtime.zip
py -3.12 tools\external_assets.py install C:\Downloads\amadeus-character-kurisu.zip
py -3.12 tools\external_assets.py status
```

If a prepared Qwen pack is unavailable, download the upstream snapshot into
the same canonical location. Runtime inference remains offline and will not
start an implicit download when the microphone is opened:

```powershell
.\.venv_cu124\Scripts\python.exe -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; snapshot_download('Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B', local_dir='assets/models/asr/qwen3-asr-0.6b')"
```

The Japanese GPT-SoVITS frontend prepares an OpenJTalk dictionary on first
use. Prewarm it once if the normal application launch must remain offline:

```powershell
.\.venv_cu124\Scripts\python.exe -c "import pyopenjtalk; print(pyopenjtalk.g2p('準備完了'))"
```

### Configure and launch

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Provide the DeepSeek API key, then review:

- **Models:** `deepseek`, the official endpoint, `deepseek-v4-flash`, and an API key;
- **Voice:** Qwen model directory, GPT-SoVITS **v3** checkpoints, reference audio/text, microphone, AEC, and barge-in;
- **General:** optional character-pack status and presentation settings.

Launch Amadeus directly:

```powershell
.\run_electron_cu124.bat
```

Use **Restart backend to apply** after changing startup settings. A
**Not installed** character pack is healthy and does not disable Chat, Work,
or headless startup.

## Compatibility routes

### Optional local LLM

To use llama.cpp instead of the remote Main Chat baseline, set
`LLM_PROVIDER=local`, configure its executable/GGUF or an existing
OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and start it when needed:

```powershell
.\start_llm_server.bat
```

LM Studio, Ollama, llama-cli, and hybrid profiles remain available, but none is
an automatic fallback after a DeepSeek failure.

### CPU/model-less

CPU/model-less remains available for CI, headless development, and text
Chat/Work:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip==26.2 setuptools==83.0.0 wheel==0.47.0
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e .
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\verify_python_environment.py --profile cpu
$env:AMADEUS_PYTHON = (Resolve-Path .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe)
.\run_electron_utf8.bat
```

Set `TTS_BACKEND=disabled` and disable Wake for a strict text-only profile.
Remote DeepSeek is the first-release Main Chat profile. OpenAI-compatible remote
ASR/TTS remain explicit compatibility routes.

### Optional remote model recommendations

These are recommended profiles for the current APIs. They do not change the
role split above, and Amadeus never switches Providers silently after an endpoint
failure:

| Responsibility | Recommended profile | Current boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Main Chat API | DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731: `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com` and `DEEPSEEK_MODEL_NAME=deepseek-v4-flash` | `deepseek-v4-flash` is the stable API alias currently pointing to the 0731 release; the dated version is not used as the runtime model id. |
| Multimodal / Vision | Prefer `gemini-3.7-flash`; use `gemini-3.5-flash` as a more conservative compatibility profile | Host-owned visual context performs capture in-process, while image delivery still follows the Main Chat Provider. Independent Gemini Vision API routing is not implemented and does not imply restoring the retired Gemini Live sidecar. |
| Work execution Provider | Prefer Codex App Server; use the optional OpenClaw Gateway second | This is a recommendation order, not an automatic failure fallback. Browser remains the specialized Provider for web tasks. |
| Work execution model | Codex App Server may explicitly select a GPT-5.6-family model or `deepseek-v4-flash` | The execution model belongs to the Work Provider and does not share Main Chat routing or credentials. |
| AUIP runtime action decisions | `AUIP_ACTION_PROVIDER=openai`, `AUIP_ACTION_MODEL=gpt-5.6-terra`, `AUIP_ACTION_REASONING_EFFORT=low`, and `AUIP_ACTION_SERVICE_TIER=fast` | This model decides AppSession actions and participation; it is not the execution Provider that authors an AUIP Artifact. `fast` requires availability for the API project. |

## External models and runtime assets

Model weights, reference audio, character packs, and large or copyright-
sensitive media are distributed separately. The source repository keeps the
required icons, default wallpaper, schemas, validators, and installation tool.

The current directory contracts are `asr-qwen3-0.6b`,
`voice-kurisu-gpt-sovits-v3`, `visual-runtime`, and `character-kurisu`. The
first two form the full local-voice profile; the latter two affect only scene
and character presentation.

```powershell
py -3.12 tools\external_assets.py verify C:\path\to\asset-bundle.zip
py -3.12 tools\external_assets.py install C:\path\to\asset-bundle.zip
py -3.12 tools\external_assets.py status
```

A SpriteForge character package ultimately lands at:

```text
assets/spriteforge/runtime/kurisu/
  runtime_manifest.json
  graph_config.json
  spriteforge_mouth_config.json
  textures/
```

The installer preserves the canonical `assets/...` layout, verifies SHA-256,
skips identical files, and rejects unexpected overwrites. See
[external asset bundles](docs/external_asset_bundles.md) and the
[character-pack contract](docs/character_pack_authoring.md).

### Wallpaper mode (Lively Wallpaper recommended)

On Windows, the open-source
[Lively Wallpaper](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively) is the recommended
host for Amadeus's web wallpaper; Wallpaper Engine remains compatible. Start
Amadeus, add the local webpage URL below to Lively (WebView2 is recommended),
then click **Wallpaper** in the Amadeus sidebar:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:17777/wallpaper/lively/index.html
```

This stable entry discovers the actual asset and bridge ports automatically
and waits in place while wallpaper mode is off. Do not hard-code `17778` or
`17797`. For diagnostics, run
`py -3.12 tools\run_wallpaper_engine_bridge.py` and use the printed `Lively URL`.
See the [Lively entry guide](wallpaper/lively/README.md).

macOS has no corresponding Lively/Wallpaper Engine desktop host. When
**Wallpaper** is activated, Electron hosts the full scene on the primary
display and uses a separate transparent window for the interactive Canvas;
secondary displays receive matching backdrops only. The scene remains
click-through so it does not block Finder desktop icons. This is a community
real-device candidate, not an official macOS support claim. Dependency and CI
work is tracked by [#46](https://github.com/Code-Amadeus/Amadeus/pull/46), and
signing, notarization, and an installer are not included yet.

## Configuration ownership

Startup values use one precedence order:

1. Parent-process environment variables (highest authority; shown as locked in the GUI)
2. Electron desktop settings
3. Repository-root `.env`
4. Defaults in `config/settings.py`

Settings never rewrites `.env`. Ordinary models, voice, microphones,
Providers/MCP, vision, avatars, and character-pack status belong in the GUI;
advanced diagnostics, experimental thresholds, and test-only flags remain in
`.env`. Secrets use the operating system's `safeStorage` encryption. See
[configuration ownership](config/README.md) and
[local instance authentication](docs/local_instance_authentication.md).
